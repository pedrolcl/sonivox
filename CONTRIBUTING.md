# Contributing to Sonivox

Thank you for considering contributing to Sonivox!

## Workflow

We do not allow merge requests into the `master` branch directly. Please follow these steps:

1. Fork (and clone) the repository. If you already had a fork from previous contributions, then [sync your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) from time to time.
2. Create a new branch from `devel` for your changes.
3. Open an issue describing the contributions you plan to make.
4. Make your changes and commit them with clear commit messages.
5. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the `devel` branch.
